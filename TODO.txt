Functionality / fixes:
- adjust rim bodies; ball seems to hit collider before mesh, too hard to sink
- I think the start screen is still visible whilst playing

Gameplay:
- Spacebar bounce
- Tweak throw values so it's easier to land shots
- Score tracker

Visual:
- Aiming arc should end with some sort of visual cue to show where ball will hit (circle shader or sth)
-- render on top or position above to stop z fighting?
- Hoop net should use cloth physics

UI:
- Splash screen; loading status, start button, control scheme
- Charge meter for throws
- Pause/resume screen for re-locking controls

SFX:
- Ball sfx
- Score sfx (scoreboard beeps?)

Performance:
- optimise assets
- merge geometry
- anything else? ask gpt!
